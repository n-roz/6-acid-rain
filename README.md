# Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## Description

For this project, I attempted to build a a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Using [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) the base URL should look like the following: 

```https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}```

I really struggled with this one! And now I'm finding myself in a bit of a time crunch so I'm hoping to submit this project for partial credit. I had so much difficulty with the API. I will re-work this project so I can add it to my portfolio.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Mock Up

Please view my very sad project below. I know it's incomplete but I am hoping to earn as much partial credit as possible.

## Project Requirements

```
Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%
Satisfies all of the above acceptance criteria plus the following:
It does this, although unsuccessfully - Uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data
There's an attempt - Uses localStorage to store persistent data

Deployment: 32%
Yes - Application deployed at live URL
Can be argued yes - Application loads with no errors
Yes - Application GitHub URL submitted
Yes - GitHub repository that contains application code

Application Quality: 15%
Well, there's not much going on so I would say yes - Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate
I consider almost bare HTML clean - Application user interface style is clean and polished
Not really - Application resembles the mock-up functionality provided in the Challenge instructions

Repository Quality: 13%
Yes - Repository has a unique name
Yes - Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions
Yes - Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
Maybe - Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages
Yes - Repository contains quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application
```

I remember this project being more completed so I'm disappointed with myself now that I'm opening this on the final due date to submit for partial credit. Dear grader, I do apologize. I don't expect a good grade but partial credit would help me out a lot. Thank you!
